The universal and individualtraits of learning such tasks reflect our cognitive abilities and havebeen of interest both psychophysically and clinically. From a computationalperspective, these tasks are hard, because the number ofpatterns and rules one could consider even in simple cases is exponentiallylarge. Thus, when we learn to classify we must use simplifyingassumptions and generalize. Studies of human behavior in probabilisticlearning tasks have focused on rules in which pattern cues areindependent, and also described individual behavior in terms ofsimple, single-cue, feature-based models. Here, we conducted psychophysicalexperiments in which people learned to classify binarysequences according to deterministic rules of different complexity,including high-order, multicue-dependent rules. We show thathuman performance on such tasks is very diverse, but that a classof reinforcement learning-like models that use a mixture of featurescaptures individual learning behavior surprisinglywell. Thesemodelsreflect the important role of subjects' priors, and their reliance onhigh-order features even when learning a low-order rule. Further,we show that these models predict future individual answers toa high degree of accuracy. We then use these models to build personallyoptimized teaching sessions and boost learning."	sum1	"<b>Cohen Y</b>, Schneidman E (2013) ""High-order feature-based mixture models of classi cation learning predict individual learning curves and enable personalized teaching"". <i>Proc Natl Acad Sci</i> USA 110:684689."	cohen-schneidman-pnas	https://www.pnas.org/content/110/2/6842015-10-19	"It All Depends on the Context, but Also on the Amygdala"	Neuron	"Behavioral flexibility requires the brain to maintain and rely on cognitive contexts for dictating appropriate responses.

The extent to which this response compromises the chronic stability of neuraldevices depends on many factors including the materials used in the electrode construction,the size, and geometry of the indwelling structure. Here, we report on the development ofmicroelectrode arrays (MEAs) based on amorphous silicon carbide (a-SiC). Approach. Thistechnology utilizes a-SiC for its chronic stability and employs semiconductor manufacturingprocesses to create MEAs with small shank dimensions. The a-SiC films were deposited byplasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition and patterned by thin-film photolithographictechniques. To improve stimulation and recording capabilities with small contact areas, weinvestigated low impedance coatings on the electrode sites. The assembled devices werecharacterized in phosphate buffered saline for their electrochemical properties. Main results.MEAs utilizing a-SiC as both the primary structural element and encapsulation werefabricated successfully. These a-SiC MEAs had 16 penetrating shanks. Each shank has across-sectional area less than 60 _m2 and electrode sites with a geometric surface area varyingfrom 20 to 200 _m2. Electrode coatings of TiN and SIROF reduced 1 kHz electrode impedanceto less than 100 kOhm from ~2.8 MOhm for 100 um^2 Au electrode sites and increased the chargeinjection capacities to values greater than 3 mC cm_2. Finally, we demonstrated functionalityby recording neural activity from basal ganglia nucleus of Zebra Finches and motor cortexof rat. Significance. The a-SiC MEAs provide a significant advancement in the developmentof microelectrodes that over the years has relied on silicon platforms for device manufacture.These flexible a-SiC MEAs have the potential for decreased tissue damage and reducedforeign body response. The technique is promising and has potential for clinical translationand large scale manufacturing."	sum3	"Deku F, <b>Cohen Y</b>, Joshi-Imre A, Kanneganti A, Gardner TJ, and Cogan SF (2018) ""Amorphous Silicon Carbide Ultramicroelectrode Arrays for Neural Stimulation and Recording"". <i>J.

Arrays with transverse dimensionsof 10um or below are thought to minimize the inflammatory response; however, the reductionof implant thickness also decreases buckling thresholds for materials with low Young's modulus.While these issues have been overcome using stiffer, thicker materials as transport shuttles duringimplantation, the acute damage from the use of shuttles may generate many other biotic complications.Amorphous silicon carbide (a-SiC) provides excellent electrical insulation and a large Young`smodulus, allowing the fabrication of ultrasmall arrays with increased resistance to buckling.Prototype a-SiC intracortical implants were fabricated containing 8 - 16 single shanks which hadcritical thicknesses of either 4um or 6um. The 6um thick a-SiC shanks could penetrate rat cortexwithout an insertion aid. Single unit recordings from SIROF-coated arrays implanted withoutany structural support are presented. This work demonstrates that a-SiC can provide an excellentmechanical platform for devices that penetrate cortical tissue while maintaining a critical thicknessless than 10um."	sum4	"Deku F, Frewin C, Stiller A, <b>Cohen Y</b>, Aqeel S, Joshi-Imre A, Black B, Gardner TJ, Pancrazio JJ, and Cogan SF (2018) ""Amorphous Silicon Carbide Platform for Next Generation Penetrating Neural Interface Designs"". <i>Micromachines</i>, 9(10), 480."	micromachines-deku-paper	https://www.mdpi.com/2072-666X/9/10/4802019-02-28	A geometric representation unveils learning dynamics in primate neurons	bioRxiv	"Primates can quickly and advantageously adopt complex rule-based behaviors. We studiedacquisition of rule-based classification while recording single neurons in the dorsal-anteriorcingulate-cortex (dACC) and the Striatum. Monkeys performed trial-by-trial classification on a richset of multi-cue patterns, allowing de-novo rule-learning with varying conceptual complexities everyfew days. To examine neural dynamics during the learning itself, we represent each rule with aspanning set of the space formed by the stimulus features. Because neural preference can beexpressed by feature combinations, we can track neural dynamics in geometrical terms in thisspace, allowing a compact universal description of neural trajectories by observing changes ineither vector-magnitude and/or angle-to-rule. We find that a large fraction of cells in both regionsfollow the behavior during learning. Neurons in the dACC mainly rotate towards the rule, suggestingan increase in selectivity that approximates the rule; whereas in the Putamen we additionally find aprominent magnitude increase, suggesting strengthening of confidence. Moreover, magnitudeincreases in the striatum followed rotation in the dACC, and finally, the neural policy at the end ofthe session predicted next-day behavior. Using this novel framework enables tracking of neuraldynamics during learning and suggests differential roles of confidence and policy for the differentbrain regions."	sum5	"<b>Cohen Y</b>, Schneidman E, Paz R (2019) ""A geometric representation unveils learning dynamics in primate neurons"". <i>bioRxiv</i>"	cohen-schneidman-paz-biorxiv	https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2019/02/28/561670.full.pdf2020-05-01	Hidden neural states underlie canary song syntax	Nature	"Coordinated skills such as speech or dance involve sequences of actions that follow syntactic rules in which transitions between elements depend on the identity and order of past actions. Canary songs are comprised of repeated syllables, called phrases, and the ordering of these phrases follows long-range rules, where the choice of what to sing depends on song structure many seconds prior. The neural substrates that support these long-range correlations are unknown. Using miniature head-mounted microscopes and cell-type-specific genetic tools, we observed neural activity in the premotor nucleus HVC as canaries explore various phrase sequences in their repertoire. We find neurons that encode past transitions, extending over 4 phrases and spanning up to 4 seconds and 40 syllables. These neurons preferentially encode past actions rather than future actions, can reflect more than a single song history, and occur mostly during the rare phrases that involve history-dependent transitions in song. These findings demonstrate that HVC dynamics includes 'hidden states' not reflected in ongoing behavior - states that carry information about prior actions. These states provide a possible substrate to control syntax transitions governed by long-range rules."	sum6	"<b>Cohen Y</b>, Shen J, Semu D, Leman DP, Liberti WA III, Perkins N, and Gardner TJ (2020).
