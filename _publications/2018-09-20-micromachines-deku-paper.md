Microelectrode arrays that consistently and reliably record and stimulate neural activityunder conditions of chronic implantation have so far eluded the neural interface community dueto failures attributed to both biotic and abiotic mechanisms. Arrays with transverse dimensionsof 10um or below are thought to minimize the inflammatory response; however, the reductionof implant thickness also decreases buckling thresholds for materials with low Young&apos;s modulus.While these issues have been overcome using stiffer, thicker materials as transport shuttles duringimplantation, the acute damage from the use of shuttles may generate many other biotic complications.Amorphous silicon carbide (a-SiC) provides excellent electrical insulation and a large Young`smodulus, allowing the fabrication of ultrasmall arrays with increased resistance to buckling.Prototype a-SiC intracortical implants were fabricated containing 8 - 16 single shanks which hadcritical thicknesses of either 4um or 6um. The 6um thick a-SiC shanks could penetrate rat cortexwithout an insertion aid. Single unit recordings from SIROF-coated arrays implanted withoutany structural support are presented. This work demonstrates that a-SiC can provide an excellentmechanical platform for devices that penetrate cortical tissue while maintaining a critical thicknessless than 10um.
