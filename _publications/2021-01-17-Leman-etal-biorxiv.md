title: "Large-scale cellular-resolution imaging of neural activity in freely behaving mice"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2021-01-17-Leman-etal-biorxiv
excerpt: 'Miniaturized microscopes for head-mounted fluorescence imaging are powerful tools for visualizing neural activity during naturalistic behaviors, but the restricted field of view of first-generation ‘miniscopes’ limits the size of neural populations accessible for imaging. Here we describe a novel miniaturized mesoscope offering cellular-resolution imaging over areas spanning several millimeters in freely moving mice. This system enables comprehensive visualization of activity across entire brain regions or interactions across areas.'

Miniaturized microscopes for head-mounted fluorescence imaging are powerful tools for visualizing neural activity during naturalistic behaviors, but the restricted field of view of first-generation ‘miniscopes’ limits the size of neural populations accessible for imaging. Here we describe a novel miniaturized mesoscope offering cellular-resolution imaging over areas spanning several millimeters in freely moving mice. This system enables comprehensive visualization of activity across entire brain regions or interactions across areas.
