title: "Hidden neural states underlie canary song syntax"

excerpt: 'We observe that the prior state or past syllable information is revealed in calcium activity during a fixed sequence of four canary phrases – showing that Ca2+ signals do not just reflect the current state or current transition. These properties, as well as the existence of neurons with calcium activity, locked to the same phrase type in a subset of phrase sequence histories, may be a signature of new forms of phrase-level hidden states in HVC that, with further investigation, will allow us to refine models of syntax control for species that sing complex songs.'

History dependent behavior is a key readout of neural processing. In skills, like speech or dance, motor sequences follow syntactic rules in which transitions between motor elements rely on past actions. Canary songs are defined by syllable repeats, called phrases, whose syntax exhibits long range order. The phrase sequence neural underpinnings must either rely on fixed action patterns or maintain historic context to influence ongoing transitions. 
To discriminate such mechanisms, we recorded Ca2+ signals from the premotor
nucleus HVC in freely behaving canaries. We find that song history is reflected in identified ROIs up to 4 phrases apart, spanning up to 3 seconds and 40 syllables and that some ROIs exhibit mixed history selectivity. Moreover, we find that signals, reflecting sequence history information are more frequent during phrase transitions that are history dependent compared
to history insensitive ones. These findings suggest that the network dynamics reflects historic context relevant to flexible transitions. Additionally, we find ROIs whose signals last several seconds and span 3-4 phrases. These signals are rarely modulated by syllable or phrase boundaries and initiate mostly during stereotyped sequences, suggesting distinct network dynamics during stereotyped and variable behavior.
