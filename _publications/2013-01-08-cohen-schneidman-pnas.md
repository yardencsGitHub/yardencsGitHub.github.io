excerpt: '<p style=&quot;text-align: justify&quot;>
  Concept-based classification learning tasks are commonly used to explore learning strategies in humans. The universal and individual traits of learning such tasks reflect our cognitive abilities and have been of interest both psychophysically and clinically. I designed and performed psychophysical experiments in which subjects learned to classify binary sequences according to deterministic rules of different complexity. To capture the wide variety of behavior, I developed reinforcement learning models using a mixture of stimulus features and a gradient based learning rule. Fitting models to individuals revealed the importance of their priors, their use of high order features, and suggested that the dynamics may take a very simple form. To validate the models, I demonstrated their ability to predict future behavior and support personally optimized guided learning.</p>

  Pattern classification learning tasks are commonly used to explore
learning strategies in human subjects. The universal and individual
traits of learning such tasks reflect our cognitive abilities and have
been of interest both psychophysically and clinically. From a computational
perspective, these tasks are hard, because the number of
patterns and rules one could consider even in simple cases is exponentially
large. Thus, when we learn to classify we must use simplifying
assumptions and generalize. Studies of human behavior in probabilistic
learning tasks have focused on rules in which pattern cues are
independent, and also described individual behavior in terms of
simple, single-cue, feature-based models. Here, we conducted psychophysical
experiments in which people learned to classify binary
sequences according to deterministic rules of different complexity,
including high-order, multicue-dependent rules. We show that
human performance on such tasks is very diverse, but that a class
of reinforcement learning-like models that use a mixture of features
captures individual learning behavior surprisinglywell. Thesemodels
reflect the important role of subjects&apos; priors, and their reliance on
high-order features even when learning a low-order rule. Further,
we show that these models predict future individual answers to
a high degree of accuracy. We then use these models to build personally
optimized teaching sessions and boost learning.
