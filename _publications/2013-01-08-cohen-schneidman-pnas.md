Pattern classification learning tasks are commonly used to explorelearning strategies in human subjects. The universal and individualtraits of learning such tasks reflect our cognitive abilities and havebeen of interest both psychophysically and clinically. From a computationalperspective, these tasks are hard, because the number ofpatterns and rules one could consider even in simple cases is exponentiallylarge. Thus, when we learn to classify we must use simplifyingassumptions and generalize. Studies of human behavior in probabilisticlearning tasks have focused on rules in which pattern cues areindependent, and also described individual behavior in terms ofsimple, single-cue, feature-based models. Here, we conducted psychophysicalexperiments in which people learned to classify binarysequences according to deterministic rules of different complexity,including high-order, multicue-dependent rules. We show thathuman performance on such tasks is very diverse, but that a classof reinforcement learning-like models that use a mixture of featurescaptures individual learning behavior surprisinglywell. Thesemodelsreflect the important role of subjects&apos; priors, and their reliance onhigh-order features even when learning a low-order rule. Further,we show that these models predict future individual answers toa high degree of accuracy. We then use these models to build personallyoptimized teaching sessions and boost learning.
