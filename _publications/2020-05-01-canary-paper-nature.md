excerpt: 'Motor skills with long-range sequence dependencies are common in complex behaviors, with speech the richest example. In general, the neural mechanisms underlying long-range motor sequence dependencies are unknown. Using miniaturized head-mounterd fluorescence microscopes and genetic tools I revealed coding of such memory-dependent syntactic properties in singing canaries.'
