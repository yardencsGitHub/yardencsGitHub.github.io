<p>My research in systems neuroscience aims to understand the how neurons cooperate in a massively interconnected network to generate high-level cognitive functions. Keeping the mind-body problem in mind, I believe that an answer to this question entails creating a mechanistic understanding of how from unreliable spiking neurons, connected with plastic synapses, emerge stable brain structures that support reliable functionality. To dissect these basic mechanisms, my research projects develop experimental approaches to observing neural ensembles and algorithmic and computational frameworks to analizing complex behavioral and neurophysiological datasets.</p>
  
<p> There are very few truly unique ideas in science (and elsewhere). My main approach, reflected in all my work,
