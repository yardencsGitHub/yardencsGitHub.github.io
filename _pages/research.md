<div style="text-align: justify">
<p>My research in systems neuroscience aims to understand the how neurons cooperate in a massively interconnected network to generate high-level cognitive functions. Keeping the mind-body problem in mind, I believe that an answer to this question entails creating a mechanistic understanding of how from unreliable spiking neurons, connected with plastic synapses, emerge stable structures that support reliable functionality. To dissect these basic mechanisms, my research projects develop experimental tools to observing neural ensembles and algorithmic and computational frameworks to analizing complex behavioral and neurophysiological datasets.</p>
  
<p>My main approach to dissecting neural mechanisms is to use high-dimensional behavior tasks and analyses to gain access to and create simpler representations of key elements. Put simply, in taking a complex data set or problem and projecting it onto many dimensions it is often much simpler reveal separate components and relevant patterns. This principle is the basis to the success of deep artificial neural network algorithms and to leading hypotheses about the function of the neocortex.</p>
