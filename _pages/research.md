### Aim and Approach
<div style="text-align: justify">
<p>My research in systems neuroscience aims to understand how neurons cooperate in a massively interconnected network to generate high-level cognitive functions. Keeping the mind-body problem in mind, I believe that an answer to this question entails creating a mechanistic understanding of how from unreliable spiking neurons, connected with plastic synapses, emerge stable structures that support reliable functionality.</p>
  
<p>To dissect these basic mechanisms, my research projects develop experimental tools for observing neural ensembles and algorithmic and computational frameworks to analizing complex behavioral and neurophysiological data. My main approach is to use high-dimensional behavior and analyses to gain access to and create simpler representations of key elements. This may seem paradoxical but, put simply, in taking a complex data set or problem and projecting it onto many dimensions it is often much simpler to untangle separate components and identify relevant patterns. In fact, this principle is the basis to the success of deep artificial neural network algorithms and to leading hypotheses about the function of the neocortex.</p>

<p>Another tenent I hold dear is the role of time as a key variable ("well duh" says the ethologist). Often, neural systems are treated as (pseudo) static - frozen computing machines. Such approach, in effect, flattens the dynamic nature of the brain and makes many processes, different learning algorithms for example, become indiscriminable. In all my experiments, the time and sequence components of behavior serve as strong constraints to potential theories that could explain my results.</p>

## Canaries - Excellent singers and fantastic models for investigating neural computations

Canaries, like starlings, nightingales, and blackbirds (to name a few), are virtuosos capable of producing minute-long songs composed of many different individual notes. These notes, often called syllables, are sung in variable sequences that almost never repeat exactly and create an impressive repertoire. Such behavioral richness allows investigating the mechanisms responsible for producing complex behaviors but also creates challenges in annotating the different syllables and in statistical analyses.  

### Working memory in canary song syntax
Canary songs are comprised of repeated syllables, called phrases. The ordering of phrases, like human language, follows long-range syntax rules [1], spanning several seconds.

Tools
=====
I enjoy developing hardware and software tools. Neuroscience research is, almost by its nature, interdisciplinary. Technical problems arising in research have, therefore, a unique interdisciplinary flavor. Creating solutions to these problems is, in some sense, an easier challenge than research itself because these are usually technical and not feasibility issues. Still, it is fun and very rewarding to create solutions that advance my work and contribute to the work of others.
