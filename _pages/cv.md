Research Interests:
======
Systems Neuroscience, Neuroethology, Complex Systems, Reinforcement Learning, Tool development,
Motor Sequencing & Learning, Dynamical Systems, Electrophysiology, Neurophotonics.

Education
======
* Ph.D in Neurobiology, Weizmann Institute of Science, 2016 (*advisors: Prof. [Rony Paz](https://www.weizmann.ac.il/neurobiology/labs/rony/) and Elad Schneidman*)
* M.Sc. in Physics, Weizmann Institute of Science, 2010 (*advisor: Prof. [Elad Schneidman](https://www.weizmann.ac.il/neurobiology/labs/schneidman/The_Schneidman_Lab/Home.html)*)

Research Experience:
======
### Research Fellow  <span style="float:right;">May 2020 to present</span>
**Williams Lab, Massachusetts General Hospital Department of Neurosurgery and Harvard Medical School.**
<p style="text-align: justify">Research Summary: Use novel ultrahigh resolution microelectrode arrays to study the processes by which humans
produce and comprehend language: project design, neuronal analysis and modeling, and manuscript writing.</p>

### Postdoctoral Associate  <span style="float:right;">January 2016 to April 2020</span>
**Gardner Lab, Boston University Department of Biology.**
<p style="text-align: justify">Research Summary: (1) Adapted calcium imaging techniques to awake behaving canaries and studied neural coding of correlated song sequences. The key finding was that hidden network states support behavior transition syntax rules with long-range history dependence. (2) Deep neural network algorithms development - outperforming
the state-of-the-art method for birdsong annotation. (3) Collaborated with the Cogan lab from UT Dallas to
develop scalable ultramicroelectrode arrays for neural stimulation and recording.</p>

### Graduate Student <span style="float:right;">October 2007 to January 2016</span>
**Paz and Schneidman labs, Weizmann Institute of Science Department of Neurobiology.**
<p style="text-align: justify">Research Summary: Modeled human classification learning. Found that visual feature-based reinforcement learning models can capture, predict and be used to influence behavior - and boost learning. Trained monkeys on classification tasks and recorded single neurons while the animals learned new rules. Developed a novel projection
of neural activity on visual features to discover different learning dynamics in cortex and striatum.</p>

**Popular lectures for school children** <span style="float:right;">2018</span>
Overview: [My presentations](/talks/2018-11-20-talk-3) in a local elementary school, "What can we learn from songbirds?" aim to communicate the passion for science and describe some of the questions we have and how songbirds can
help us answer them in the lab.
