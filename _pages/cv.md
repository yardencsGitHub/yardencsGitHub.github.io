Research Interests:
======
Systems Neuroscience, Neuroethology, Complex Systems, Reinforcement Learning, Tool development,
Motor Sequencing & Learning, Dynamical Systems, Electrophysiology, Neurophotonics.

Education
======
* Ph.D in Neurobiology, Weizmann Institute of Science, 2016 (*advisors: Prof. [Rony Paz](https://www.weizmann.ac.il/neurobiology/labs/rony/) amd Elad Schneidman*)
* M.Sc. in Physics, Weizmann Institute of Science, 2010 (*advisor: Prof. [Elad Schneidman](https://www.weizmann.ac.il/neurobiology/labs/schneidman/The_Schneidman_Lab/Home.html)*)
* B.Sc. in Physics and Mathematics, Hebrew University, 2000

Research Experience:
======
## Postdoctoral Associate  (*January 2016 to Present*)
**Gardner Lab, Boston University Department of Biology.**
Research Summary: (1) Adapted calcium imaging techniques to awake behaving canaries and studied neural
coding of correlated song sequences. The key finding was that hidden network states support behavior transition
syntax rules with long-range history dependence. (2) Deep neural network algorithms development - outperforming
the state-of-the-art method for birdsong annotation. (3) Collaborated with the Cogan lab from UT Dallas to
develop scalable ultramicroelectrode arrays for neural stimulation and recording.

## Graduate Student (October 2007 to January 2016)
**Paz and Schneidman labs, Weizmann Institute of Science Department of Neurobiology.**
Research Summary: Modeled human classification learning. Found that visual feature-based reinforcement
learning models can capture, predict and be used to in
fluence behavior - and boost learning. Trained monkeys on
classification tasks and recorded single neurons while the animals learned new rules. Developed a novel projection
of neural activity on visual features to discover different learning dynamics in cortex and striatum.

Service and leadership
======
**Popular lectures for school children (*2018*)**
Overview: [My presentations](/talks/2018-11-20-talk-3) in a local elementary school, "What can we learn from songbirds?" aim to communicate the passion for science and describe some of the questions we have and how songbirds can
help us answer them in the lab.

**Ad Hoc Referee:** journal of behavioral processes (*2017-present*)
