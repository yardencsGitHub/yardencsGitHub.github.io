Education
======
* B.Sc. in Physics and Mathematics, Hebrew University, 2000
* M.Sc. in Physics, Weizmann Institute of Science, 2010 (*advisor: Prof. [Elad Schneidman](https://www.weizmann.ac.il/neurobiology/labs/schneidman/The_Schneidman_Lab/Home.html)*)

Research Experience:
======
## Postdoctoral Associate  (*January 2016 to Present*)
**Gardner Lab, Boston University Department of Biology**
Research Summary: (1) Adapted calcium imaging techniques to awake behaving canaries and studied neural
coding of correlated song sequences. The key nding was that hidden network states support behavior transition
syntax rules with long-range history dependence. (2) Deep neural network algorithms development - outperforming
the state-of-the-art method for birdsong annotation. (3) Collaborated with the Cogan lab from UT Dallas to
develop scalable ultramicroelectrode arrays for neural stimulation and recording.
Graduate Student October 2007 to January 2016
Paz and Schneidman labs, Weizmann Institute of Science Department of Neurobiology
Research Summary: Modeled human classication learning. Found that visual feature-based reinforcement
learning models can capture, predict and be used to in
uence behavior - and boost learning. Trained monkeys on
classication tasks and recorded single neurons while the animals learned new rules. Developed a novel projection
of neural activity on visual features to discover dierent learning dynamics in cortex and striatum.
