Developed and presented a graduate level lecture for the Sensory Neurobiology course (CAS NE520) at BU. In this lecture I used my own research in canaries as a case study for systems neuroscience research. Specifically, I focused on the challenge of investigating neurophysiological signals and relating them to cognitive functions.
